3.6R codes for a forward port (the ones that are different from P+EX 1.26.1)

0. QuickLava's Kirby hat program
- IKHM_v1.1.0 folder with two files

1. From Source/3.6R...
- DuplicateCostume had been added, but could be scrapped
- SSSPageAdvance's feature, making the R button switch stage pages, is essential; I wonder if it can be added to Source/Extras/More.asm to lighten RSBE01
- YellowTeam is also necessary, but it's unfinished: it currently replaces green team instead of adding a 4th team

2. From Source/Extras...
- More has a code we need that disables DPad on the SSS

3. From Source/LegacyTE...
- AltCostume, which has been edited from P+ to disable alt costumes
- LoadFlags, also to disable alt costumes
- TagsControls has been edited in 3.6R, but I'm not sure on what this one change does; seems related to teams
- UnboundedTeamEngine also seems to have been edited in the past for teams

4. From Source/P+Ex...
- KirbyHatEX, recent code ported and edited the other day by KJP to make Kirby hats function properly
- Subspace is different, with "Stamina Behaviour is Defined Individually Per Fighter v1.1" added

5. From Source/Project+...
- CodeMenu has various line differences and I cannot tell what they do from the file alone; the same file has been there unedited in the repo since Pyro's first gameplay porting attempt
- FilePatchCode changes a "Project+" path to "P+EX" in three lines
- PSA reverts Project+ gameplay codes
- ScreenKO reverts other Project+ codes
- StageFiles accounts for the Mario Bros. stage's placement in 3.6R
- StageTable has been edited entirely to rearrange stages

6. From Source/ProjectM...
- CloneEngine has been edited to remove lines related to P+EX characters
- Constants has been edited for DK Cargo Hold Time, I suppose it matches vanilla 3.6 but I haven't checked
- Elements has been edited for Cape behavior
- SSS has been edited to change the default cursor position

-----------------------------------

Side notes
- Source/Extras/ShorthopMacro is present (but unused?) in both P+EX 1.26.1 and current 3.6R, and should be removed
- Let's remove Source/P+Ex/BigHeadMode

-----------------------------------

Gameplay-related code work by PyroPM, other changes first by ilikepizza107 and QuickLava, then also by KJP
