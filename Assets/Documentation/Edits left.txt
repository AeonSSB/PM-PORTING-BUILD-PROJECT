To do:
- Fix all known bugs related to gameplay not being 1:1 with 3.6
- Port the remaining P+ 2.4 files
- Fix the issues of the same-costume code
- Check for unused/unnecessary codes to remove like ShorthopMacro in Source/Extras

In the CSS:
- Manage every character's costumes and UI (and replace stocks in if_adv_mngr too for Subspace)
  (change Mewtwo's UI only after PM Porting is... well, ported)
- Replace the blue of the assets with a shade based on the build's brand


In the two Rules menus:
- Manage the stage slots considered by the game for random selection
  - THEN Manage the included button alts in the code that counts them to be only R and Z
  - THEN Rename Peach's Castle, Yoshi's Island and others if needed in the random selection
- Replace the blue of the assets with a shade based on the build's brand


In stages:
- Rebrand the Castle Siege slot to Temple of Time and Castle Siege (Brawl)'s one to Castle Siege
- Check if Autumn Dream Land's water needs changes
  - THEN Do a quality check of the other alts
    - Fix Peach's Castle (Melee)'s window and trees priority; remake the character lighting
- Some stages including Kongo Jungle have invisible targets that big hitboxes in the Z-axis hit,
  move them where nothing can possibly hit them or remove them if possible
- In Bowser's Castle, player 2 Ganon can fall through the stage after dropping the angel platform
  or at least he used to be able to, and he shouldn't
- A rock in Distant Planet has a texture error, fix it in both Brawl and PM's stages as well as
  the planned GHZ alt we're making
- Fix Lugia's idle animation in the dedicated Metal Cavern alt once the stage is done
- Hardcode even spawn points for doubles when 2v2 team match happens regardless of ports


In the SSS:
- Fix the stage preview's shadow's crop
- Replace the placeholder texture with a proper "-> Page 4", remake the others too if a template
  is not found
- Rename the following stages in their names' textures:
  *Secret+ to Twisty Trials Galaxy 
  *Rumble Falls to Rumble Falls (Brawl)
  *Castle Siege to Castle Siege (Brawl)
- Add the stages (pac, param, modules, sawnd) and UI to their emtpy slots in pages 1 and 4
  - THEN Add the alts for page 1's slots that exist
  - THEN Port Spain's water visual cue on all three FoD stages
  - THEN Make the page 1 and 2 alts that don't exist yet
  - THEN Adjust crates and barrels for all stages
  - THEN Set from Common2 the stages loaded in Classic Mode
  - THEN Check if All-Star and other modes need the same fix in Classic Mode for the loaded stages
  [After all stages' individual changes are done]
  - THEN Make Rules banners for each slot
  - THEN Make banners for each slot
  - THEN Make the My Music menu identical to the SSS
  - THEN Make an horizontal version of the SSS and a toggle for it
    (and import WI build's "STAGE SELECT" text animation?
    also note that previews of the horizontal SSS should be based on PM, not TE)
- Add stats icons above the previews (Z axis) for the stages in page 1
- Port 50CC for SSS to have stocks in the upper left corner of the screen after we do characters'
  cosmetics
- Replace the blue with a shade based on the build's brand
- Replace the "Project M" texture with our final logo?


To do elsewhere:
- Match Brawl's tracklists and manage extra music from there
  (Ensure tracklists include all Brawl and Melee tracks, and also arrangements of the 64 tracks)
  - THEN Import music from the sound selection
  - THEN Check if menus like Replay can have custom tracklists
  - THEN Check if it's possible to make the added tracks appear in the Music menu
    (Not My Music, the Brawl menu dedicated to music of the game itself rather than stages)
- Ensure STGResult displays 3.6 and other relevant information on the version like our title
- Make HD textures for the result screen's port information work
- Make the descriptions of ALC and Buffer in the two Rules menus say "for beginners" or similar
- Make UI that notifies if a port is using ALC or buffer (or tilt stick too?)
- Make custom StrapXX files with the build's brand, optimized in file size like P+'s ones
  - THEN Rename HD textures for it
- Make a custom title screen with the build's brand, and make the logo appear in Brawl's intro
  - THEN Rename HD textures for it
- Remake the aspect ratio image in the settings
- Remove unnecessary HD textures (stage icons, names, banners etc.)
- Apply all the following misc fixes:
  *Ensure Kirby's Roy hair is updated to match default Roy's one after we finish Roy's costumes
  *A missing HD texture on the Subspace Emissary icon from the main menu?
  *Replace the outdated ZSS trophy texture
  *Toon Link's Down Taunt had a texture error, fix it if P+ 2.3.2 didn't yet or if PM Porting
   restores it
- Make all macros visible on screen when needed to:
  *LRAstart on pause
  *LRAYstart on pause
  *LRDpadDown for debug mode on some menus
  *LR when selecting a stage brings back to the CSS
  (any other?)


To do in the Code Menu:
- Ensure these Code Menu options are included and can you see in-game if settings are not default:
  *Green flash when actionable
  *Yellow flash when in IASA
  *Orange flash with SDI inputs
  *Grab Trade Behavior (Manaphy)
  *Balloon Hit Behavior
  *Hitfalling
- Make L-R-A-START, salty runback, debug mode, stage alts, Wario-man and Giga Bowser, stage page
  switch etc. accessible through analog L and R presses too (from 80% of a press? a value that
  does not need the spring under the button of GCC, not sure on the one to use; digital press
  should still work)
  *And any other code that uses L and R I might have forgotten
- Add the EX characters toggle once we decide on which fighters to include, and port their files
  (they'll unlikely have 18 costumes like the main cast; maybe 9 or 6)
  (Code Menu toggle or, even better, button in the CSS itself)


To do in Dolphin:
- Create a custom theme after the build's brand
- Dolphin Software icon themed after the build's brand
- Dolphin Launchers banner themed after the build's brand
- Custom Dolphin window icons (Open, Refresh etc.) themed after the build's brand
- Make sure Bird's Replay Manager works as intended
- Remove the autoupdater
- Rename the emulator with the build's brand


To do at the very end:
- Remove all collect.vff and leave only one in the folder that loads it
- Reset music frequency and tags once the build is done
- Make sure there aren't screenshots, unused HD textures or dumped textures on Dolphin
- Convert HD textures to .dds (might not be compatible with rollback)
- Re-set the SD card path if edited
- Update the credits of each character's alts and each stage in credits.txt
- Update LegacyTE_PSA_edits.txt with all characters and add it to pf/fighter
- Have the following Dolphin settings:
  *Set Default ISO to ./Games
  *Theme: the custom one themed after the build's brand
  *Aspect Ratio: Stretch to Window
  *Widescreen Hack
  *Internal Resolution: 3x
  *Load Custom Textures
- Make a document that introduces to the build and/or charts with:
  *tracks used (and info similarly to how P+ handles this)
  *costumes featured
  *stages featured

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character-specific notes (any has to be done after PM Porting):
- Fix Fierce Deity's sword trail
- Ensure any other trail uses the correct colours if costume-dependent
- Restore Melee Fox's Shine model
- Add Gen 2 shiny intro for costumes that need it
- Ensure Final Smash eyes of characters like Puff and Ness work properly

Legal stage-specific notes for 1:1s:
- Use the plugins for stage legality on every alt and check framerate on console;
  the following data should match:
  *stagePosition
  *most of the STPM (aside from character wind and shadows)
  *collisions
  *collision type (Olimar can desync with a different type)

If you edit the collision type (changing wood to metal) you may accidentally desync Olimar.
You have to manually go to the collision data file and change the soil (which is usually
the default) and change the GFX and SFX number on it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
