To do:
- Take the updated Lunar Horizon and PS2 transformations 1:1s from WI P+
- Fix all known bugs related to gameplay not being 1:1 with 3.6
  *Snake's grenade timing
  *Ice Climbers' P+ infinite
  *Kirby's hats
  *C-stick behaviour after Samus' SWD
  *Dedede's Waddledash
- Fix the lag on console
- Port the remaining P+ 2.4.2 files
- Recolor Peach's turnips
- Implement P+ GFX except Ganondorf's Up Tilt
  *Remake the Snake C4 effect
  *Make all Pok√©mon costumes with shinies have their sparkles, and when needed add the Gen 2
   specific one
  *Ensure both Kirby and Falco have the laser hue change in P+ for color blindness implemented,
   P+ missed one of them (at least in previous versions)
- Port the random potion from P+ on Toon Link's taunt
- Implement the code for uncapped damage ratio
- Implement the code for music selection before stages
  *If possible, fix the visual oddity after selecting a track
- Remove unused/unnecessary codes like ShorthopMacro in Source/Extras, check if there are more


In the CSS:
- Manage every character's costumes and UI
  - Then replace stocks in if_adv_mngr too for Subspace
  - Then replace info_corps.pac to fix stocks in All-Star mode
- Replace the blue of the assets with a shade based on the build's brand
- Restore the old rules' shape one and the two behind them, make the Versus shape less tall
- Update the crop of the flash that appears when selecting a character to match the most recent
  CSP crop


In the two Rules menus:
- Manage the stage slots considered by the game for random selection
  - THEN Manage the included button alts in the code that counts them to be only L and Z
  - THEN Rename Peach's Castle, Yoshi's Island and others if needed in the random selection
      - Information on current Random, to work with in different ways depending on how much
	control we have on that menu and its stage loading:
	- Random feature:
	  - Rumble Falls in Random loads Rumble Falls (Brawl)
	  - Golden Temple in Random loads Twisty Trials Galaxy;
	    its image may not show the cosmetic revamp
	- Cosmetic:
	  - Delfino's Secret's image may not show the cosmetic update
	  - Metal Cavern's image may not show the cosmetic update
	  - Yoshi's Story's image may not show the cosmetic update
	  - Rumble Falls has the PM stage's preview
	  - Metroid Lab will need its name and image replaced once we complete Ceres Space Colony
	  - Dream Land's image in Random hasn't been updated to show the mesh edit
	  - Castle Siege's image in Random hasn't been updated to show the Brawl stage over P+'s
	  - Distant Planet has the PM stage's preview
	  - Infinite Glacier in Random hasn't been renamed to Summit, nor the image has been updated
	  - Skyworld has the PM stage's preview
	  - Sky Sanctuary Zone's image has not been updated to show the cosmetic revamp
	    - In general, Random images and previews may get upgrades
- Replace the blue of the assets with a shade based on the build's brand
- Add a third option in Auto L-Cancel, "Per port", that makes the code in the code menu for
  per port ALC work; make it so that if this toggle in the Rules is set to either Off or On,
  that code doesn't work
  *Do the same for Input Buffer


In stages:
- Port P+'s visual improvements of Delfino's Secret to the original one
- Some stages including Kongo Jungle have invisible targets that big hitboxes in the Z-axis hit,
  move them where nothing can possibly hit them or remove them if possible
    - Check which stages other than Kongo Jungle have this issue
- In Bowser's Castle, player 2 Ganon can fall through the stage after dropping the angel platform
  or at least he used to be able to, and he shouldn't
- Complete the other edits mentioned in the google sheet
- Hardcode even spawn points for doubles when 2v2 team match happens regardless of ports


In the SSS:
- Make the stage preview template
    - Add stats textures above the previews (Z axis) for the stages in page 1
    - Add the assets dedicated for L alts that turn visible when used in the slot you hover on
    - Restore game icons above the series icons?
- Make the cursor start on the center of the stage slots instead of the center of the screen
- Add the remaning stages (in red in the chart) and update what needs changes (in yellow)
  - THEN Adjust crates and barrels for all stages
  - THEN Set from Common2 the stages loaded in Classic Mode
  - THEN Check if All-Star and other modes need the same fix in Classic Mode for the loaded stages
  [After all stages' individual changes are done]
  - THEN Make Rules banners for each slot
  - THEN Make banners for each slot
  - THEN Make the My Music menu identical to the SSS
  - THEN Make the horizontal version of the SSS and a toggle for it
    (and import WI build's "STAGE SELECT" text animation?)
- Port 50CC for SSS to have stocks in the upper left corner of the screen after we do characters'
  cosmetics
- Replace the blue with a shade based on the build's brand


Elsewhere:
- Make icons visible near a BP when the port has ALC and/or Input Buffer active
  - THEN make the textures and HD textures
- Apply the changes from the .txt with the custom tags
- Add the necessary textures and HD textures for yellow team
- Add the "Yellow team!" quote over "Green team!"
- Update all the "Congratulations!" images that need to be replaced
  *Mario's classic mode
  *Donkey Kong's all star mode
  *Bowser's all star mode
  *Ice Climbers' all star mode
  *Lucario's all star mode
- Make the custom crop for the Result Screen Portraits?
- "Net-MyMusic.asm is missing Salty Runback Expansion Stage Music Fix and the other MyMusic
  address fix" as of 2.3.2, take the fixes if in the current P+ or make them
- Show which characters one has picked for All-Star mode battles while still in the CSS
- If possible, replace the "Rotation" icon with "Tourney" and make it load a normal versus but with
  a fixed ruleset you can change from a code menu toggle; if that's not possible, implement the WI
  build's ruleset freeze toggle
- Ensure tracklists include all Brawl and Melee tracks, and also arrangements of the 64 tracks
  - THEN Import music from the sound selection
- Check how menus like Replay can have custom tracklists (document all of Brawl's menus if
  possible)
- Check if it's possible to make the added tracks appear in the Music menu
  (Not My Music, the Brawl menu dedicated to music of the game itself rather than stages)
- Make HD textures for the result screen's port information work (bit color depth might be related)
- Implement the All-star mode stock fix after we finish characters' cosmetics
    - (Is is the same mentioned in the CSS section of the text?)
- Make the descriptions of ALC and Buffer in the two Rules menus say "for beginners" or similar
- Replace the grass in the "ways to play" screen with a Smashbox and have an HD texture too
  (note that the screen alters images' proportions)
- Make UI that notifies if a port is using ALC or buffer
- Make custom StrapXX files with the build's brand, optimized in file size like P+'s ones
  - THEN Rename HD textures for it
- Make a custom title screen with the build's brand, and make the logo appear in Brawl's intro
  - THEN Rename HD textures for it
- Fix Latias' spawn
- Fix the black eyes Mewtwo and Fox can get on stages like Spear Pillar
- Apply all the following misc fixes:
  *Ensure Kirby's Roy hair is updated to match default Roy's one after we finish Roy's costumes
  *A missing HD texture on the Subspace Emissary icon from the main menu?
  *Replace the outdated ZSS trophy texture
  *Toon Link's Down Taunt had a texture error, fix it if P+ 2.3.2 and above didn't yet or if PM
   Porting restores it
- Make all macros visible on screen when needed to?
  *LRAstart on pause
  *LRAYstart on pause
  *LRDpadDown for debug mode on some menus
  *LR when selecting a stage brings back to the CSS
  *all tag-related button effects
  (any other?)


In the Code Menu:
- Rename the Project+ folder to 3.6R (or something like Reloaded if it can't have ".")
- Ensure these Code Menu options are included and can you see in-game if settings are not default:
  *Green flash when actionable
  *Yellow flash when in IASA
  *Orange flash with SDI inputs
  *Grab Trade Behavior (Manaphy)
  *Balloon Hit Behavior
  *Hitfalling
- Fix the red flash on failed L-Cancel (If ALC is on for a port, it also activates Red Flash on
  failed LC even if that's currently OFF)
- Ensure P+ didn't change anything about Subspace other than addressing crashes and check that
  SSEEX features can't be turned on by accident at least before the end of the main campaign, so
  that Subspace speedruns are unchanged from vanilla 3.6
- Make L-R-A-START, salty runback, debug mode, stage alts, Wario-man and Giga Bowser, stage page
  switch etc. accessible through analog L and R presses too (from 80% of a press? a value that
  does not need the spring under the button of GCC, not sure on the one to use; digital press
  should still work)
  *And any other code that uses L and R I might have forgotten
- Add T+'s secondary code menu (and try to address issues if there still are any)
- Fix Wario loading (in P+ it currently loads Biker Wario with plumber's cosmetics)
- After everything else, add the EX characters toggle once we decide on which fighters to include
  as well as their files (uncertain)
  *They'll unlikely have 18 costumes like the main cast; maybe 9 or 6
  *Code Menu toggle or, even better, button in the CSS itself


In Dolphin:
- Remove unnecessary HD textures (stage icons, names, banners etc.)
- Create a custom theme after the build's brand
- Dolphin Software icon themed after the build's brand
- Dolphin Launchers banner themed after the build's brand
- Custom Dolphin window icons (Open, Refresh etc.) themed after the build's brand
- Make sure Bird's Replay Manager works as intended
- Remove the autoupdater
- Rename the emulator with the build's brand


At the very end:
- Replace the PM website in the loading screen with a link or message related to Reloaded
- Remove all collect.vff and leave only one in the folder that loads it
- Reset music frequency and tags once the build is done
- Make sure there aren't screenshots, unused HD textures or dumped textures on Dolphin
- Convert HD textures to .dds (might not be compatible with rollback)
- Re-set the SD card path if edited
- Update the credits of each character's alts and each stage in credits.txt
- Update LegacyTE_PSA_edits.txt with all characters and add it to pf/fighter
- Have the following Dolphin settings:
  *Set Default ISO to ./Games
  *Theme: the custom one themed after the build's brand
  *Aspect Ratio: Stretch to Window
  *Widescreen Hack
  *Internal Resolution: 3x
  *Load Custom Textures
- Make a document that introduces to the build and/or charts with:
  *tracks used (and info similarly to how P+ handles this)
  *costumes featured
  *stages featured
- Create a website to promote Project M 3.6R


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character-specific notes:
- Fix Fierce Deity's sword and the trail
- Ensure any other trail uses the correct colours if costume-dependent
- Restore Melee Fox's Shine model
- Add Gen 2 shiny intro for costumes that need it
- Ensure Final Smash eyes of characters like Puff and Ness work properly

Legal stage-specific notes for 1:1s:
- Use the plugins for stage legality on every alt and check framerate on console;
  the following data should match:
  *stagePosition
  *most of the STPM (aside from character wind and shadows)
  *collisions
  *collision type (Olimar can desync with a different type, grass reduces traction etc.)

If you edit the collision type (changing wood to metal) you may accidentally desync Olimar.
You have to manually go to the collision data file and change the soil (which is usually
the default) and change the GFX and SFX number on it
