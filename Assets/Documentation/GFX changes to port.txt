Differences from TE and P+ to port:

Mewtwo		Colored trails for the tail like in P+
Sonic		Has etc trails for the spindashes on different color costumes PAC based;
		ensure side B and down B trails are differenciated like in P+
DK		Bruising on boxer DK PSA based
Lucario		Shiny has sparkles PSA Based;
		P+ added subtle different trail colors based on meter strength
Ike		P+ sword trails (check these with Ike players, an outdated white trail was
		not liked but apparently Ike got a new one later on that matches the Brawl
		artstyle better);
		ensure sword shape changes are considered for both Armored Ike and Greil Ike
		if needed
Meta Knight	Different GFX for sword shape changes
Zard		Shiny has sparkles, add gen 2 shiny sparkles and sound for gen 2 shiny
Ivysaur		Shiny has sparles;
		razor leaf changes glow on certain costumes PSA Based;

		Ivysaur gained a new victory animation
Pikachu		Shiny has sparkles PSA Based, add gen 2 shiny sfx and gfx if needed
Pit		Arrow color varies on costumes PSA and Model Based;
		sword trails and similar effects change based on alts too
Mario		Ensure capes either match PM or P+'s management of their colours
Link		P+ sword trails (and fix Fierce Deity's one);

Toon Link 	Implement the different sword effects for alts for sword shape changes
Jigglypuff	Add gen 2 shiny sfx and gfx if needed
Rob		Wii rob light is blue PSA Based
Squirtle	Shiny sparkles PSA Based, add gen 2 shiny sfx and gfx if needed
Ganondorf	Sword taunt draws model from PAC
Peach		Ensure models spawned have unique textures for the costumes (Fsmash,
		Toads too?), and make new hues for turnips based on the feedback in
		the server
Snake		C4 edit in the server
Samus		In P+ she got the color flash effects on the beam switch taunt adjusted,
		they blink out oddly in PM
Kirby & Falco	Make the accessibility edit on the hue for laser match
Yoshi		Egg break GFX


   P+ changes deliberately keeping out:
   - Ganon Up Tilt dark GFX
   - Mario Fair fire/electric GFX


   Unsure on:
   - blue fire for Dry Bowser, needs testing to see how it looks with Flame Breath
   - Scrapped PM intro animation for Link


To check:
- Is the GFX of Mewtwo having stored a fully charged Shadow Ball different between vanilla
  3.6, P+ and current 3.6R?
