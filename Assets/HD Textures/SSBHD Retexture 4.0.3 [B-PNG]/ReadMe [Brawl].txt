Q : How do I install this pack ?
____________________________________

A : You need to put the "RSB_01" folder directly in C:\Users\"PC_NAME"\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures"
If you are using a portable version of Dolphin, then put the RSB_01 folder in "Dolphin folder name"\User\Load\Textures\

After that, replace the underscore "_" by the letter matching the region of your game :
- J for Japanese version
- E for US version
- P for PAL version

Don't forget to check "Load Custom Textures" and "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the Advanced tab of Dolphin Graphics settings,
for an optimal experience.

The install is now complete, have fun !
