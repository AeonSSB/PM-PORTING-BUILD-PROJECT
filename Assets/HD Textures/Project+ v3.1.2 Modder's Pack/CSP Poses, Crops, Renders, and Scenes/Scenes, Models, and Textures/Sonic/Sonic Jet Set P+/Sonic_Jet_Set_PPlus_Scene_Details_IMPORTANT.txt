Note: This render has costume specific colors on the fur materials. These are based on the FurEnv materials. 

If you go into LightChannel0, and then AmbientColor, you can see the material color for a specific costume.

For Jet Set those colors are

Default: 7D7DDB
Yellow Jet Set: F5EFC2
Red Jet Set: DDC2DB
Blue Jet Set: DFF4FF
Purple Jet Set: E7E0FD

The render currently has set the color to: 7D7DDB

Each object material that has fur in the blend has a Soft Light mix that requires the AmbientColor, and you need to use the appropriate color from the pac material. Be sure to check this on both head materials, plus the quill and tail material.
