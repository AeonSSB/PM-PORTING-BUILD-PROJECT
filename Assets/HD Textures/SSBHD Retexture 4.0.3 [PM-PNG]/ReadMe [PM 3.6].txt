Q : How do I install this pack ?
____________________________________

A : You need to put the "_rename" folder directly in C:\Users\"PC_NAME"\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\"
If you are using a portable version of Dolphin, then put the "_rename" folder in "Dolphin folder name"\User\Load\Textures\

After that, rename the folder by the Game ID, depending on the Project M version you're using :
- RSBEF2 for Netplay Build version
- 00000000 for Launcher Version (SD process)
- RSBE01 for Stage Builder exploit

Don't forget to check "Load Custom Textures" and "Prefetch Custom Textures" in the Advanced tab of Dolphin Graphics settings,
for an optimal experience.

The install is now complete, have fun !
