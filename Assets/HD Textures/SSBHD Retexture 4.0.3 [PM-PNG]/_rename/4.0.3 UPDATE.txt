4.0 (March 2015)
----------------

- All textures have been converted to the new Dolphin Custom Texture format, Yeah !
Unfortunately, this update concerns only Project M at the moment, Brawl will be updated as soon as possible. 
Thanks to the new format, the pack is compatible with the numerous versions of PM (Launcher, Iso Builder, Gecko OS, Netplay etc...) 
No more useless folders on my Dropbox! Yeah !!!
Just a reminder, you need to rename the main folder (RSBEPM for Iso Builder ver., RSBEC3 for Netplay, 00000000 for Launcher etc...) 
- Now match with Project M 3.5 perfectly !
- New fonts for the menus, following the PM design
- Several files'aspect ratio have been corrected (70%), way to go!
- Character Selection Screen now matches perfectly with the original design
- Several textures of the main menus have been remade
- Peach, Captain Falcon and Zero Suit Samus got new CSPs
- Various CSPs have been added/corrected
- Battle Portraits as well
- New stock icons
- Thanks Winchester7314 for the Golden Metal Mewtwo (CSP/BP) and the Xbox/PS3 buttons
- Deleted "3_2_1_GO!" folder, all files have been moved in the "Brawl" folder
- Removed the "Bonus" folder from the pack and put it in the Dropbox/Mediafire folder instead
- HD updated strap loaders (put the Wii language in Japanese to actually see them =p). They will be included in the Brawl packs
- A bunch of new textures I can't remember of, so many changes ... ^^"

Nota : Due to the new custom texture format, it's been obvious that the new updated pack will not work with all revisions before 
Dolphin v4.0-5234, version which includes the new texture system. An Archives folder has been created for this purpose on my 
dropbox/mediafire folder, containing all past textures pack of this project.
Unfortunately, I will not provide support for these versions anymore, but feel free to re-use them.
