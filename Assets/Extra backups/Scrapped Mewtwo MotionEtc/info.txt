Attempt at lowering the filesize through removing the Lucario boneset.

Found that Mewtwo uses one of the Lucario ear bones in the misc section of his PSA file,
so maybe the fact that that goes unanimated in the optimizations makes it mess up somehow.
(referring to a t-pose grab release)

Saw desyncs happen when hitting airborne Mewtwo with Up Air from behind and Nair.
