3.0 Frequently Asked Questions

3.1 What is FBX version 2012?

When you convert an FBX file to the FBX 2012 FBX Version, the file becomes
compatible with the Autodesk FBX 2012 Plug-ins (i.e. 2012.2).

If you are using an older FBX Plug-in version in your destination application, we
recommend that you update the destination application's FBX Plug-in.
Otherwise, you must convert your FBX file to the corresponding FBX Version 
(e.g. FBX 2009) so your FBX files are compatible.

3.2 What happened to my old command line arguments?

If you use the FBX Converter command line version (FbxConverter.exe) for batch
processing or through a script, you may need to update these batch files or scripts
This is because some command line arguments have changed in the 2009 versions of
the Converter.  However, the default values have not changed. 

The following arguments have been renamed:

"/smoothgroup" has been replaced with "/splitnormals" 
"/refnode" has been replaced with "/addroot" 
"/rescale" has been replaced with "/convertunit" 
"/texuvbypoly" has been replaced with "/uvbypoly"
