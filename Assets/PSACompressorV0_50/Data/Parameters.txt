Bone ID/Hitbox ID
The bone the collision bubble is attached to/The ID number of the collision bubble. Where XXXXYYYY is X=Bone ID, Y=Hitbox ID. To generate multiple hitboxes, need to change the ID. If generate a hitbox with the same ID as an existing hitbox, it will be overwritten. If hit multiple hitboxes, Only the lowest ID is valid. Also, if add 0x100 to ID, increases Segment value by 1. Even if the target has already been hit by hitbox, target is a possibility of hitting more higher segment value hitbox.

Also, the actual knockback adds "Base Knockback" value to this. Note: Weight Knockback is enabled only when the value of both the Knockback Growth and Weight Knockback is not 0.	200*OC_WK:4
Shield Damage/Base Knockback
The amount of additional damage dealt to the target's shield if it is up/The momentum the target is launched regardless of target's weight and damage. Where XXXXYYYY is X=Shield Damage, Y=Base Knockback. Also, the actual knockback adds Base Knockback to either Knockback Growth or Weight Knockback, whichever is valid.

Weight Knockback
The momentum the target is launched is the higher the hitbox's damage, the greater the momentum, and the greater the target's weight, the more momentum tends to decrease. Target's damage doesn't affect momentum. Weight Knockback is enabled only when the value of both the Knockback Growth and Weight Knockback is not 0. And, the actual knockback adds total Weight Knockback to total Base Knockback.
Base Knockback
The momentum the target is launched regardless of target's weight and damage. Also, the actual knockback adds Base Knockback to either Knockback Growth or Weight Knockback, whichever is valid.
Element

Targets will be unable to use f-tilts, and using an air attack in either direction produces a f-air. Special moves tend to act as if the character is facing right. Getting hit by something else, using an f-smash, or using a side special will end the strangeness.
