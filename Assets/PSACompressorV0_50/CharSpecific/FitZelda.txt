0x2C H Preservation at End
Horizontal preservation after travel. Compared to 0x24, the effect is only for a short time. If set to 0, there will be no movement after horizontal movement. It can be made faster than during travel, but it does not exceed the limit horizontal speed.

Final Smash: Light Arrow

0x0 H Camera Movement at Hit
Horizontal Camera Movement at Hit. If set to 0, there will be no horizontal movement of the camera.

0x4 V Camera Movement at Hit
Vertical Camera Movement at Hit. If set to 0, there will be no vertical movement of the camera in most cases.

0x8 Camera Initial V Position at Hit
It seems to be this value related to the initial vertical position of the camera at the time at hit. For example, if set to 50, the camera will more often rotate from under the floor and approach when attack hit. However, there are also cases where it comes around from above. On the other hand, if set to -50, the zoom will end with the camera showing from above, and will not show from below.

0xC H Camera Rotation at Hit
This value is related to the horizontal angle that the camera moves rotate at hit. The higher this value is, camera more turn the rotation, but there is an upper limit. Normally don't go around to the back of the stage. If set to 0, there will be no horizontal movement of the camera, but there is a case that zooms horizontally and from a diagonal angle.

0x10 Camera Rotation at Hit
This value is related to the angle that the camera moves rotate at hit. The higher this value is, camera more turn the rotation, but there is an upper limit. Normally don't go around to the back of the stage. If set to 0, there will be no vertical movement of the camera, but there is a case that zooms vertically and from a diagonal angle.
