0x14 Maximum  Downhill Speed
Maximum speed for acceleration when going down a slope. If set to 0, the speed will not change on a slope.

0x18 Deceleration
Horizontal speed deceleration

0x1C Minimum Speed after Deceleration
Minimum speed after deceleration. Normally, when the speed falls below this speed, it will be accelerated until it reaches this speed. When the speed becomes 0, accelerate to the right.

0x2C
Value relate to rotation speed

0x30
Value relate to rotation speed. If 0x34 is 0 and this value is greater than or equal to 0x2C, the rotation speed will be faster when the forward speed is fast, and the rotation speed will be 0 when the forward speed is below a certain speed.　If the value is less than 0x2C, the reverse is true, the rotation speed will be 0 if the forward speed is above a certain speed.

0x34
Values related to rotation speed. The higher the value, the faster the rotation.

0x38 Rotation Speed Multiplier
Rotation speed multiplier during Action.

0x3C Wall Bounce H Multiplier
Wall bounce horizontal momentum multiplier. If set to 0, if hits the left wall, the character will move slowly to the right, and if it hits the right wall, the character will continue straight forward.

0x40 Slope Deceleration
Deceleration when going up a slope. When the forward speed runs out, it goes down the slope.

0x44 Slope Acceleration
Acceleration when going down a slope.

0x48 Additional forward damage
Value that affects the damage added as the speed is faster. Actual damage is Hitbox damage + Current speed * This value.

0x4C Acceleration Multiplier by Damage Taken
This value is speed multiplier that accelerates when take damage. Actual acceleration speed is Damage * This Value. The direction of acceleration is determined by Hitbox's Angle Flip. (Even if the knockback direction is in the opposite direction, the character accelerates in the reference direction.)

*0x50 Footstooled Cancel
If this value is shorter than the animation length when the character is footstooled by someone during an action, the flipping animation will be canceled even if the character is footstooled by someone during an action on the ground.

0x0 Turn Sensitivity
The input strength required to change direction the moment "RA-Bit[18] = true" is read. However, even if the value is set to over 1, the direction can be changed at the start and 3 frames after the start.

0x4 Sensitivity
Forward/backward sensitivity. If over 1, can't change jumping Angle.
