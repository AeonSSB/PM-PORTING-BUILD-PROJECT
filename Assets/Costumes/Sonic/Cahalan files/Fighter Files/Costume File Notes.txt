The costume files are uncompressed should you want to use them outside of P+
or other builds that have costume file compression enabled in their code sets.

If you want to compress the costume files, use Extended LZ77.

Also, each of the costumes here have been further optimized by:
1. Removing redundant materials
2. Removing unused Mip-Mapping settings (Final Smash Eyes)

For the Light Speed Shoes + Crystal Ring alt ("Dreamcast"a alt):
1. The Main Body and Heady textures had mip-map levels removed.
2. Removing redundant materials
3. Removing unused Mip-Mapping settings (Final Smash Eyes)

Technical Features:
1. The Light Blue alt from Smash 4 has glow-in-the-dark accessories.
2. The Crystal Ring and Gold Bits on the Dreamcast Alt also glow in the dark.

As for Costume specific trails (for Project+), those will have to be
done by the end-user (you!).

This isn't too hard however, as you need only PSACompressor and some patience.
================================================================================
The new etc files were chosen to be largely compatible
with P+'s current "Ghost Trails" for Sonic.

There are some combinations that might look off or
need fine tuning, but I'll leave that up to the user.

Here's the current combination of ETC files to
"Ghost Trails".
=======================================================
00 - Default (Blue)		| 00 - Blue
01 - Brawl Red			| 01 - Red
02 - Brawl Green		| 02 - Green
03 - Cobalt Emerald		| 00 - Blue
04 - Brawl Yellow		| 05 - Yellow
05 - Brawl Black		| 04 - Grey
06 - Smash 4 White		| 06 - White
07 - Smash 4 Light Blue		| 00 - Blue
08 - Smash 4 "Pink"		| 03 - Purple
09 - Orange Warmers		| 05 - Yellow
10 - Hedgehog Brown		| 05 - Yellow
11 - Title Bracelets		| 03 - Purple
14 - Darkspine			| 03 - Purple or 05 - Yellow (referential)
15 - Mirror Match		| 04 - Grey
16 - Time Stone			| 07 - Lime
17 - Dreamcast			| 00 - Blue

Ghost Trails
=============
0 - Blue
1 - Red
2 - Green
3 - Purple
4 - Grey
5 - Yellow
6 - White
7 - Lime

I do not know how many more clr animations can be added
to the PSA before it starts to crash due to filesize;
But these are the following colors I'd add in order of priority:
8  - Orange
9  - Brown
10 - Pink


As for the PSA Editing itself, go to the GFX Section of Subroutine 2E5AC.
LA-Basic[54] is the costume check command.
Any alts not listed use the default blue "Ghost Ball" trails.
