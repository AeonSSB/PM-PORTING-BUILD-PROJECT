Notes on files from Project+'s "2.4.2 to 2.5.2" download:

- Unsure about how the files in Project+/Source/ProjectM can affect gameplay in ways that
  derail from 3.6 behaviour
	- The content of Project+/Source/ProjectM/SpecialModes should be safe

- Unsure about Project+/Source/Project+/Hurtbox.asm too

- At first glance, I get the impression that some codes are meant to perform the same ways
  as older ones but in a more readable format

- Inside Project+/Source/Project+ check if the new StageFiles.asm and StageTable.asm have changes
  we should port to our own files and aren't only about stages Project+ added

- I don't know where that's stored, but we shouldn't include the "Sword trails visible during
  hitlag" code

Remembering that our build takes P+EX as a base alongside initial edits by Pyro for 3.6 gameplay
porting, it'd be best to have a backup of P+ 2.3.2 and the latest P+EX for any needed comparison
between files.

A quick way to check for any unwanted change in physics after porting files would be to test the
Stomping Tantrum tech, as we know it's not in P+.

I recommend we handle any files from pf/fighter separately at a later time unless specific codes
require us to do otherwise.
From these files we generally have to take and port individual things to avoid accidental moveset
changes. Said things can be checked from the patch notes in P+'s website.
For example:

- From FitPokeLizardon we need to take what makes an ember appear during his lounging victory
  pose, assuming we didn't address this on our own already. Needs a check in-game.

- Ganondorf facial expressions during sword taunt attack (the punch is not in 3.6 iirc)

When it comes to stages, we should take the files from melee_No_Item_EX and replace the stages we
use with the updated ones, then mass update all stages in the build for the new item features
through the dedicated plugin. Do note that of our stages PS2 Bell Tower and Pok√© Floats 2 break
with that plugin, those need to be updated manually. (P+ also mentions Bell Tower, but it's a
stage we're not using)
One important note is that we happened to update stages ourselves at times. When replacing a
stage with the equivalent from melee_No_Item_EX we should check the file history of our stage on
github to look for any updates we happened to make.
